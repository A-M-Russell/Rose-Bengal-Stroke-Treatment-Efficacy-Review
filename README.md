# Stroke-Surgical-Severity-Review

### Review Question
What is the effect of skull surgery on infarct volume and behaviour in the Rose-Bengal animal model of
ischaemic stroke?

### Context and rationale
All existing animal models of stroke involve some degree of surgical intervention, which could have major
effects on stroke outcome and thus confound the translation of animal studies into effective human
treatments (Howells et al., 2010). It is already known that soft-tissue surgery can cause a cascade of
inflammatory changes which may affect lesion formation in the brain (Murray et al, 2014). Furthermore,
breaching the skull to access the brain (a common requirement of many stroke models) reduces cranial
pressure, which is often used in humans as a therapeutic intervention to improve outcomes after stroke
(Goyal et al., 2016, Hofmeijer et al., 2009). These factors mean that surgery may modulate both the stroke
outcome as well as the course of disease, creating challenges with the way the resulting data can be
interpreted.

The Rose Bengal model of stroke uses a photo-sensitive dye combined with a laser shone on the vessels of
the brain to induce a photochemical reaction causing the formation of thrombi and subsequent stroke
(Watson et al., 1985). This model can be generated either by shining the laser directly onto the skull, onto
skull that has been thinned, or directly onto the brainâ€™s surface following a craniotomy. These variations in
the Rose Bengal method provide a unique opportunity to explore the effect of different surgical severities on
outcome in the same model of stroke. Understanding the interaction between surgery and stroke is crucial so
that the effects of surgery can be predicted and accounted for in future studies.
